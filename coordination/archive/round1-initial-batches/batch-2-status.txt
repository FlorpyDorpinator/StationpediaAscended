[Note: This is batch-2 device documentation for StationpediaPlus mod]
[Total devices documented: 20 of 61 from batch-2]
[Status: PARTIAL - Many modular console devices and remaining structures need documentation]

The modular console devices (ThingModularDevice*) all follow similar patterns:
- Input devices (Dial, Slider, Button, Lever, etc): Have Setting logic to read/write values, On for power, Color for LED states
- Output devices (LED, Gauge, Meter, Light, etc): Have Setting to display values, Color for customization, On for power
- All require 10W power typically
- Most connect via data cables

Remaining devices that need full documentation:
- 30+ modular console components
- Additional structures (Composter, Packaging Machine, Ovens, Chargers, Rover, etc)
- Access Bridge, Airlocks (gate/wide variants), Angled Bench, Auto Miner, Basket Hoop

These devices are documented in the Stationpedia.json but require source code analysis
to write accurate logic descriptions following the StationpediaPlus schema.
